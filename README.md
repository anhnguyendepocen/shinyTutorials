# Shiny Tutorials for Statistics Instructors

This repository contains the source code for a [MOSAIC Project](http://mosaic-web.org/) tutorial.  It is intended for statistics instructors who would like to write their own [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps for classroom use.

The tutorial itself may be viewed at the following URL (**but PLEASE first read my request below**):

>[http://homer.shinyapps.io/sim_tutorial_Rmd](http://homer.shinyapps.io/sim_tutorial_Rmd)

**Request**:  The above URL is my `shinyapps` site, for which I get a limited number of user-hours per month.  If you are a GitHub user, then please do a me favor and do not view the tutorial at the above URL.   Instead, view it locally by taking the following steps:

* Clone this repo into your computer.
* In the cloned repo, open the directory `sim_tutorial_Rmd` and find the file `tutorial_sim.Rmd`.
* Open the file and run it.  (It runs as a local shiny app.)
* Enjoy!
